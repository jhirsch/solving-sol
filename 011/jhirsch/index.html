    <!--
      Paper.js template for solving a Sol Lewitt instruction.

      Paper.js is a simple way to draw graphics with Canvas. It uses PaperScript,
      a light abstraction of JavaScript that makes it easy to draw graphics.
      It's very similar to drawing graphics with ActionScript.

      More about PaperScript: http://paperjs.org/tutorials/getting-started/working-with-paper-js/

      Note: you don't need to use Paper.js for Solving Sol. You can use any library you'd like,
      or no library at all. The only requirement is that the solution runs in a modern browser.

      If you have another library you like, please submit a template like this one for other folks to use.
